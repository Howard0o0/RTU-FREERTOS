//! ADC10_A - Sample A1 Input, DMA 64 Samples, Repeat Single
//!
//!  MSP430F550x Demo
//!  Sample A1 64 times with AVcc ref. Software writes to ADC10SC to trigger
//!  sample burst. In Mainloop MSP430 waits in LPM0 to save power until ADC10_A
//!  conversion burst complete, DMA_IFG will force exit from LPM0 in Mainloop
//!  on reti. ADC10_A internal oscillator times sample period (16x) and conversion
//!  (13x). DMA transfers conversion result in ADC10MEM0 to array ADC_Result.
//!  P1.0 set at start of conversion burst, reset on completion.
//!

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must

//! - ADC10_A peripheral
//! - DMA peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//! - A1
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
